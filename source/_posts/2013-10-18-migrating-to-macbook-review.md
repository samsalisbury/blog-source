_This [MacBook Pro with Retina Display review]() is part 1 of a [series on migrating from Windows to Mac](/blog/series#migrating-from-windows-to-mac)._ 

> Six months ago, I was lucky enough to take over development of an iOS App. This meant I needed [a Mac](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/). _I was a die-hard .NET developer, using Dell/Windows machines almost exclusively for the past 20 years. In short, I had pretty much no idea what to expect._ From what I'd heard I wasn't convinced this was a good idea... How can a developer, _a Microsoft developer,_ live with a strange keyboard, an unfamiliar OS, shiny skeuomorphic apps, and, did I mention, a strange keyboard?! _It wasn't half as bad as I expected..._

## <a id="hardware"></a> <i class="icon-laptop"></i> The Hardware ##
**15&ndash;inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 2.7GHz Core i7**

The first thing I noticed was that the hardware was incredibly precisely manufactured. I know this is gross repetition, but it's true, and it's striking&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;even my ridiculously expensive [Dell 'Precision' workstation](http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/precision-m6500/pd) was shipped with a misaligned, slightly twisted lid. The lid on this beast shut with a pleasing thud, perfectly aligned.

It's also thin, really really thin. This is basically a desktop replacement, it's probably the most powerful computer I'd ever used, and also, somehow, the thinnest and lightest. (Sure, it's no MacBook Air, but for the power in there, it's pretty amazing how little space this thing takes up.)



### <a id="trackpad"></a> <i class="icon-hand-up"></i> The Trackpad
The large, clickable trackpad, smooth and precise, didn't rattle around with gentle usage on the MacBook, like it did in most of the brand new Dell laptops in use around the office. In fact, it didn't budge a millimetre even with six months of prolonged heavy-handed abuse. Its texture was very smooth, meaning that with any dampness it became quite grippy, impinging on the usual smooth glide accross its surface. However, its size, responsiveness, and precision meant it was an absolute pleasure to use.



### <a id="display"></a> <i class="icon-desktop"></i> The Display
The high resolution display&mdash;'Retina' display in marketing lingo&mdash; was pretty stunning, and text appeared silky-smooth, and totally rounded. Not a pixel in sight. This, unfortunately, completely made a mockery of anything lower-resolution. Other monitors which had seemed perfectly fine up to this point began to look like cheap toys.



### <a id="ports"></a> <i class="icon-headphones"></i> <i class="icon-hdd"></i> <i class="icon-gamepad"></i> <i class="icon-print"></i> <i class="icon-printer"></i> The Ports
The layout of the USB, Thunderbolt, DVI, headphones and other ports was, simply, correct. Lined up as near to the base of the screen as possible, rather than arbitrarily half way down the keyboard.



### <a id="keyboard"></a> <i class="icon-keyboard"></i> The Keyboard

The flat, short-action keyboard keys, were one of the things that had always put me off Apple laptops. However, in reality they were reasonably pleasing to use, and nowhere near as flimsy as they looked. _Tick._ Some aspects of the keyboard design, though, are definitely questionable&mdash;for a Windows guy at least.

**The power button <i class="icon-off"></i> is 'just another' key,** on the top right of the keyboard. Whilst this keeps things very uniform, accidentally hitting the off button whilst typing is a little unnerving... Even though you still have to confirm before the machine actually powers down.

**The key known as 'Option' in all the docs is mysteriously labelled 'Alt'** on the physical keyboard. I believe this is only on the UK keyboards, but it's pretty darn confusing. The option symbol (⌥) is there, fortunately, but one gets a sneaking suspicion a certain level of obfuscation has been built in on purpose by Apple, perhaps to make it easy to [identify the uninitiated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Apple_Inc.#Comparison_with_a_cult.2Freligion).

**There is no hash (#) symbol.** Despite its huge popularity in programming, shell scripting, and even writing markdown. I found out later that you can type this symbol using `⌥3` (`Option+3`). Quite baffling.

**There is no delete key.** This seemed like a terrible oversight at first, and six months later still seems a very questionable decision. However one quickly becomes proficient at using the arrow keys with the backspace to achieve the same effect. You can also use `⇧⌫` (`Shift+Backspace`) to exactly replicate the delete key. In Mac parlance, this is known as a 'forward delete'.






## <a id="performance"></a> The Performance





## <a id="usability"></a> The Usability

The MacBook Pro is the most usable computer I have ever used. Its sheer usability has resulted in a number of changes to lifelong habits that I had never previously considered possible:

- **I have stopped using an external mouse and keyboard entirely.** The built-in trackpad is so good that I no longer have any need for a mouse at all. The keyboard is _good enough._ By using only the built-in keyboard&mdash;whether on the train or at my desk&mdash;my mucle memory has only one keyboard to remember, and thus touch-typing is much easier.

- **I do not _require_ external monitors for reasonable productivity.** This is in fact more related to OS X: its brilliant implementation of multiple desktops, and the ease of switching between them, means I no longer feel claustrophobic working on a single 15&ndash;inch display.






## <a id="conclusion"></a> The Conclusion
The 15&ndash;inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display is _very_ neat. It's also _very_ thin for a desktop replacement. Easily light enough to work with on one's lap all day, and to carry to work and back daily without really noticing it.

> The MacBook Pro with Retina Display is the most productive development workstation I have ever used.

Even for a Windows and Microsoft.NET developer, the experience of developing on a MacBook Pro is that of hugely increased efficiency, and even sanity. OS X is a much more accomplished laptop OS than Windows, with its multiple desktops clear menus, and sensible file system.

**My recommendation: get one, or, better, get your work to get you one! The MacBook Pro with Retina Display is the most productive development workstation I have ever used. Comments/trolls welcome ;)**

I've begun writing a Windows to OS X migration review, and I'll publish that tomorrow. Thanks for reading!
