_This [Mac Apps Roundup]() is part 3 of a [series on migrating from Windows to Mac](/blog/series#migrating-from-windows-to-mac)._

I'm a .NET developer, and have recently [made the switch](/blog/2013/10/18/migrating-to-macbook-review) from using Windows--_exclusively, for the past two decades--_[to Mac OS X](/blog/2013/10/20/migrating-to-os-x-review), running Windows in a virtual machine. The process has been almost exclusively positive.

Here are a few Mac apps I've found to be _really_ helpful in making the transition from Windows to Mac, plus a few others that are so useful I'll probably devote an entire blog post to some of them.

## Parallels Desktop

The very first thing I needed on my new Mac was a Windows environment, to continue my _business-as-usual_ .NET dev work, whilst I picked up Ruby and iOS projects on the side. Since I'm lazy and I hate waiting for computers to reboot, even if it is startlingly fast, BootCamp was simply out of the question for me. _I needed a Windows VM.__

The first thing I tried, it being a familiar name to me, was [VMWare Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/uk/products/fusion/). I was disappointed by its integration with OS X for a number of reasons. Its defaults just aren't sensible, at least not for someone just getting used to OS X, and performance (at least back when I tested it) wasn't up to scratch for intense workstation usage. I guess most people want to use their Windows VM like they're using Windows, but I would rather simplify my life by having the same set of key bindings and UI conventions on both my Windows VM and my primary OS. Edit: I hear that Fusion's performance has improved a lot since then.

So, with Fusion out of the picture, I picked up my next most familiar old virtualisation solution... [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), the long-time saviour for front-end developers testing on different verisons of Internet Exeplorer. I used VirtualBox for a day, which, despite reasonable performance and a price that cannot be beaten, just lacked a bit of fluidity in its integration with OS X, and performance wasn't anywhere near where I needed it for hardcore Visual Studio work.

The last one on my list, since I hadn't heard of it before, was Parallels Desktop, from Parallels; despite its many imperfections, this one just seems to be close enough to the sweet-spot that it's the one I've continued with
