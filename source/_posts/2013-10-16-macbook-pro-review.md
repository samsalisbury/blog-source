## MacBook Pro Review ##
**By a die-hard Microsoft.NET developer...**

About 6 months ago, I was lucky enough to briefly take over development of an iOS App. This meant I needed **[a Mac](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/)**. I was a .NET developer, _using Windows almost exclusively for the past **20 years**_ (last time I used a Mac was as a 9 year old at school). In short, I had pretty much no idea what to expect. I was a bit frightened. "No right mouse button," you say, "no delete key," you say...

## The Hardware ##
**MacBook Pro with Retina Display, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 2.7GHz Intel Core i7.**

The first thing I noticed was that the hardware was incredibly precisely manufactured. I know this is gross repetition, but it's true, and it's pretty striking&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;even my ridiculously expensive [Dell 'Precision' workstation](http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/precision-m6500/pd) was shipped with a misaligned, slightly twisted lid.

The large, clickable trackpad, smooth and precise, didn't rattle around with gentle usage on the MacBook, like it did in most of the Dell laptops in use around the office. In fact, it didn't budge a millimetre even with prolonged heavy-handed abuse.

The lid shut with a pleasing thud, perfectly aligned, and the keyboard, one of the things that had always put me off Apple laptops, was actually very easy to use, and not as flimsy as it looked.

The retina display completely made a mockery of anything I'd seen before, save for the retina iPhone displays.

The USB, Thunderbolt, DVI, headphones and other ports were in the correct place (lined up as near to the base of the monitor as possible, rather than arbitrarily half way down the keyboard). There were no buttons without purpose, unlike the strange alternative power button on my Dell, which 3 years later I still have no idea of the purpose of. Everything very neat and in the most 'obvious' place. This was truly a masterpiece of simplicity.

## Keyboard Weirdness ##
Some things about the hardware design are not, however, clear no-brainers.

- The power button is just another keyboard button, on the top right. Whilst this keeps things looking very neat, accidentally hitting the off button whilst typing is a little unnerving... Even though you still have to confirm before the machine actually powers down.

- There is no hash symbol, '#'. Despite its huge popularity in programming, shell scripting, and even writing markdown. I found out later that you can type this symbol using `Option+3`. Quite baffling.

- The key known as `Option` in all the docs is mysteriously labelled `Alt` on the physical keyboard. One gets the feeling a certain level of obfuscation has been built in on purpose by Apple, perhaps to make it easy to identify the uninitiated.

- There is no delete key. This seemed like a terrible oversight at first, and six months later still seems a very questionable decision. However one quickly becomes proficient at using the arrow keys with the backspace to achieve the same effect. (You can also use `Shift+Backspace`.)


## The Software: OS X Mountain Lion [The Software]
The transition from Windows to OS X was not as obviously a huge step up as the transition from Dell to Apple hardware was. It transpired, however, that this, too, was a huge step up in terms of usability.

There  some really weird things for a die hard Windows user to get used to in OS X:

- Windows hardly ever represent programs in OSX
Closing the main window of a program doesn't end the process, unless the program has been specifically designed to do this. This seemed quite annoying at first. A simple &#8984;+Q solves the problem, usually ending the process. This, in fact, is even better than Windows apps that don't die when you close their main window, since they typically sit in the tray, often hidden, and require a lot of mouse action to hunt them down and kill them (find icon, right click, click close, confirm that you really mean it). On OS X, &#8984;+Q is interpreted as die, now, and don't ask me if I'm sure!

## The Niggles: It's set up for _consumer_, not _developer_ usage
- The function keys (F1,F2,...) are not usable by default, fixable

## Fixing the issues

## 
The sheer usability of this machine resulted in a number of changes to lifelong habits that I had never previously considered possible:

- I stopped using an external mouse and keyboard entirely
- I did not require external monitors for basic productivity
- 

## Conclusion
Even for a Windows and Microsoft.NET developer, the experience of developing on a MacBook Pro is that of hugely increased efficiency, and even sanity. OS X is a much more accomplished laptop OS than Windows, with its multiple desktops clear menus, and sensible file system.
