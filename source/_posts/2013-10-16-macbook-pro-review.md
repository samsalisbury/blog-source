About 6 months ago, I was lucky enough to briefly take over development of an iOS App. This meant I needed **[a Mac](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/)**. I was a die-hard .NET developer, _using Windows almost exclusively for the past 20 years_&mdash;last time I used a Mac was as a 9 year old at school. In short, I had pretty much no idea what to expect. And from what I'd heard I wasn't convinced this was a good idea... How can a person, a developer, _a Microsoft developer,_ live with a strange keyboard, no right mouse button, and NO DELETE KEY?!

_Well, it wasn't half as bad as I thought..._

## <a id="hardware"></a> The Hardware ##
**15&ndash;inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 2.7GHz Core i7**

The first thing I noticed was that the hardware was incredibly precisely manufactured. I know this is gross repetition, but it's true, and it's striking&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;even my ridiculously expensive [Dell 'Precision' workstation](http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/precision-m6500/pd) was shipped with a misaligned, slightly twisted lid. The lid on this beast shut with a pleasing thud, perfectly aligned.


### <a id="trackpad"></a> <i class="icon-hand-up"></i> The Trackpad
The large, clickable trackpad, smooth and precise, didn't rattle around with gentle usage on the MacBook, like it did in most of the brand new Dell laptops in use around the office. In fact, it didn't budge a millimetre even with six months of prolonged heavy-handed abuse. Its texture was very smooth, meaning that with any dampness it became quite grippy, impinging on the usual smooth glide accross its surface. However, its size, responsiveness, and precision meant it was an absolute pleasure to use.


### <a id="screen"></a> <i class="icon-laptop"></i> The Display
The high-res&mdash;'Retina'in marketing lingo&mdash; was pretty stunning, and text appeared silky-smooth, and totally rounded. Not a pixel in sight. This, unfortunately, completely made a mockery of anything lower-resolution. Other monitors which had seemed perfectly fine up to this point began to look like cheap toys.


### <a id="ports"></a> The Ports
The layout of the USB, Thunderbolt, DVI, headphones and other ports was, simply, correct. Lined up as near to the base of the screen as possible, rather than arbitrarily half way down the keyboard. There were no buttons without purpose, anywhere. In stark contrast to my Dell, with a strange alternative power button, which 3 years on I still have no idea of the purpose of.


### <a id="keyboard"></a> <i class="icon-keyboard"></i> The Keyboard
The flat, short-action keyboard keys, were one of the things that had always put me off Apple laptops. In reality they were actually very pleasing to use, and nowhere near as flimsy as they looked. Tick.

However, some aspects of the keyboard design are certainly questionable&mdash;for a Windows guy at least.

**The power button is 'just another' key,** on the top right of the keyboard. Whilst this keeps things very uniform, accidentally hitting the off button whilst typing is a little unnerving... Even though you still have to confirm before the machine actually powers down.

**The key known as 'Option' in all the docs is mysteriously labelled 'Alt'** on the physical keyboard. I believe this is only on the UK keyboards, but it's pretty darn confusing. The symbol (⌥) is there, fortunately, but one gets the feeling a certain level of obfuscation has been built in on purpose by Apple, perhaps to make it easy to [identify the uninitiated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Apple_Inc.#Comparison_with_a_cult.2Freligion).

**There is no hash (#) symbol.** Despite its huge popularity in programming, shell scripting, and even writing markdown. I found out later that you can type this symbol using `⌥3` (`Option+3`). Quite baffling.

**There is no delete key.** This seemed like a terrible oversight at first, and six months later still seems a very questionable decision. However one quickly becomes proficient at using the arrow keys with the backspace to achieve the same effect. You can also use `⇧⌫` (`Shift+Backspace`) to exactly replicate the delete key. In Mac parlance, this is known as a 'forward delete'.


### Overall Hardware Experience
The whole thing is very neat, it's also _very_ thin for essentially a desktop replacement. Easily light enough to work with on one's lap all day, and to carry to work and back daily without really noticing it.

This laptop is truly a masterpiece of lean simplicity.




## <a id="os"></a> The Operating System
The transition from Microsoft Windows to Mac OS X was not as clear-cut advantageous as the transition from Dell to Apple hardware was. There are some quite strange things for a Windows user to get used to in OS X...

### <a id="os-bad"></a> Offputting features in OS X
**Closing a Window hardly ever ends a program.** Conversely, in Windows, you usually expect that closing a program's main window will end the program. If not, you can always look in the system tray (in fact, the '[notification area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskbar#Taskbar_elements)') to verify whether the program is really dead or not. In OS X, only certain programs seem to die when you close all their windows. This upset me for about an hour when I realised. However, a simple `⌥⇥` (`Option+Tab`) shows all running user-space programs. You can then quit the programs with a simple `⌘Q` (`Command+Q`).

**Did I mention thre's no hash (#) key?** I know, I'm banging on, but this is a real pain, especially once you start using Windows inside a VM on your Mac (more on this in a later post).

**Full-Screen Apps Only Use One Monitor** This is a very weird decision on the part of Apple. Making an app full-screen will blank out all the other monitors, rendering them useless.

### <a id="os-good"></a> Brilliant features in OS X
**Mission Control, Exposé, and Spaces, are amazing.** Nuf' said. But really, being able to swipe three fingers left or right, to access [as many desktops ('Spaces')](http://mattgemmell.com/2011/07/27/using-spaces-on-os-x-lion/), as you need is an astonishingly useful feature, especially when you don't have an external monitor. The quickness of three-fingers up, to see all open windows and desktops, known as 'Mission Control,' is also hugely useful. There is also an under-used three-fingers-down gesture to show all windows belonging to the current application ('App Exposé'). I am no longer horrified by the idea of working without [multiple](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/06/multiple-monitors-and-productivity.html) [external](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/04/three-monitors-for-every-user.html) [monitors](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/03/does-more-than-one-monitor-improve-productivity.html).




## <a id="conclusion"></a> The Ominous Conclusion
The sheer usability of this machine resulted in a number of changes to lifelong habits that I had never previously considered possible:

- I stopped using an external mouse and keyboard entirely
- I did not require external monitors for basic productivity

Even for a Windows and Microsoft.NET developer, the experience of developing on a MacBook Pro is that of hugely increased efficiency, and even sanity. OS X is a much more accomplished laptop OS than Windows, with its multiple desktops clear menus, and sensible file system.
